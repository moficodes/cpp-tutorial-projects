#Simple Game of Finding the Computer Position

The Rule of the game is very simple.

User is given a choice to create the size of grid. They can then move using a,s,d and w to move. The computer moves each time the player does and revealing its location once every 5th turn. The game ends when the user finds the computer.

*This is a very very basic version of the popular board game Scotland Yard.*

##Usage

```g++ main.cpp
./a.out```
